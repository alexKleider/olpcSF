As of Sep 11 2016
the way to add Hanta's books is as follows:

A shell script named madaabooks.sh has been prepared to make it
easier to prepare a freshly upgraded XO laptop for Madagascar.

You will be using a USB stick with the requisite files which are:
madabooks.sh (the script) and
madabooks.zip (the books wrapped up in a special format for the XO.)


Insert the USB stick and then power up the XO.  If it's for the
first time since reflashing, you'll have to go through the process
of entering a name, and (as of the most recent build,) you also
have the option of specifying gender and school grade, or you can
simply repeatedly hit 'enter' to accept defaults. 

Use the terminal to execute the following commands:
(To find the terminal you'll have to change from the spiral display
which doesn't show it, to the list version, by clicking on the top
left icon. The activities are listed alphabetically so you'll have
to scroll down to the bottom to find'terminal'.)
$ su
# mount -l
[# There will be some output, the last line of which will tell you where
[# your stick is mounted.
# cd  /run/media/olpc/<label>
# bash m13f.sh
# exit
$ exit

Once this is done, you'll have installed browser accessible content 
consisting of the 6 Malagasy nature books and a link to the Pathagar 
Book Server running on the DreamPlug. 

You might have to restart the XO for these changes to take effect.
