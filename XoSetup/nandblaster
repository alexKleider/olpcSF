AKA: How to update/upgrade many XOs ('clients') from a single
'server' machine. (Due to a bug, the server can not be an XOv4.)

Note: My use case is to batch upgrade XO version 4 laptops (client
machines) using a pre version 4, specifically a version 1.75, XO lap
top (the server machine.)

Put the image [1] you want on the 'client' machines (i.e. XO-4 image
files) onto a (preferably fat formatted) USB stick and plug it into
the 'server' machine (an XO v<4.0. I used an XO v1.75.)

Power up the server while repeatedly hitting the escape (top left: x)
key until you get the 'ok' prompt.
Enter "nb-secure" (followed by 'enter').

Power up each client _while_ pressing all 4 arrow keys (until told
to release them.)  Installation begins.  Find something else to do:-)
When all activity stops (several minutes) restart and initialize.

[1] The image consists of two files which can be found here:
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Releases
    As of Sep 10 2016 the latest version:
    http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Release_notes/13.2.7#XO-4
    ==> the following two files:
    a.
    http://download.laptop.org/xo-4/os/official/13.2.7-19/32019o4.zd
    b. http://download.laptop.org/xo-4/os/official/13.2.7-19/fs4.zip
    They need to be renamed as follows:
        fs.zd (the big file: 3/4Gig) and
        fs.zip (small file: just over 1Meg) respectively.
