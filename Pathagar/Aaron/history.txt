# The above command pauses for user input three times
# each time asking for a mysql password; a blank is accepted.

sudo vim /etc/apache2/sites-available/pathagar.conf 
# Change each instance of 'vagrant' to 'path/to/pathagar'
# In my case the following vim command does the job:
# :% substitute /vagrant/home\/alex\/pathagar/g
# AND modify (by adding "library" the WSGIScriptAlias line.
## a version of such a file accompanies this file.

sudo a2ensite pathagar.conf
sudo service apache2 reload
virtualenv -p python2.7 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.pip 
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py runserver
# Teminate server with CTL-C before going on.
ln -s . pathagar
# Is the above necessary if directory is already called 'pathagar' as
# it would be if cloned using the first command (above?)
python manage.py staticfiles
# ?Should above line be deleted?
python manage.py collectstatic
# The above command results in the following output:
#    You have requested to collect static files at the destination
#    location as specified in your settings.

#    This will overwrite existing files!
#    Are you sure you want to do this?

#    Type 'yes' to continue, or 'no' to cancel:
## I risked it and answered 'yes'.
sudo service apache2 reload

#### REMAINDER IS OF HISTORICAL INTEREST ONLY ####
## After above was done on the Raspberry Pi- a client browser (my
## laptop) successfully got to pathagar using the URL "10.0.0.11"
## (the Pi's eth0 IP address) or (after connecting to the Pi's WiFi
## access point) using the URL "10.10.10.10" (the Pi's wlan0 IP.)

### The remaining problem is that rachel is now "hidden"!
### Is there someway to configure apache 'VirtualHost' setting
### so that I could serve both pathagar AND rachel?
### The question may be answered here:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10081062/django-virtual-host-setup-apache-mod-wsgi

<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerAdmin admin@example.com
ServerName  testserver.com/django
#DocumentRoot /
WSGIScriptAlias / /home/mycode/mysite/scripts/django.wsgi
Alias /media/ /home/mycode/mysite/mysite/media/
Alias /adminmedia/
/opt/python2.7/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/
<Directory "/home/mycode/mysite/mysite/media">
     Order deny,allow
     Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

Change:
WSGIScriptAlias / /home/mycode/mysite/scripts/django.wsgi
to:
WSGIScriptAlias /django /home/mycode/mysite/scripts/django.wsgi
The first argument is the mount point, you have it to be the root of
the web server, so just change it to '/django' instead.
