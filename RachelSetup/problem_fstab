'fstab' Problem
===============

The following error::

    a start job is running for dev-disk-by

    Welcome to emergency mode! After logging in, type "journalctl -xb" to
    view system logs, "systemctl reboot" to reboot, "systemctl default" to
    try again to boot into default mode.
    sulogin: root account is locked, starting shell
    root@pi-4:~#
    
seems to occur if there is an entry in fstab, such as::

    LABEL=Rachel /mnt/Rachel ext4 defaults 0 0

when there is no appropriately labeled device to mount.
Solve the problem by replacing it with the following line::

    LABEL=Rachel /mnt/Rachel ext4 nofail 0 0

The solution proved to be the nofail option (rather than 'defaults'.)
Thanks to the sfLUG mailing list and in particular Akkana,
Michael, & Rick.
