Stub file: library-config

Set up the Pathagar Book Server,
content to reside in /var/www/library
or /home/pi/pathagar
- not yet decided.

What was done with Andi 5th and 6th of Nov. 2016:
User: pi, /home/pi

git clone https://github.com/PathagarBooks/pathagar.git
cd pathagar/
sudo apt-get install python-pip
sudo pip install -r requirements.pip
sudo apt-get install fabric
vim deploy/ubuntu/fabric.py
    Under SETTINGS, change the following:
        user => pi
        db_user => pi
        db_engine = sqlite3
        project_name => library
        project_path => '/var/www/library/%s' ...
        project_url => library.lan
vim deploy/ubuntu/settings.conf
    ADMINS = (
        ('Alex Kleider', 'alex@kleider.ca'),
        )
vim deploy/ubuntu/virtualhost.conf
    Look it over- unlikely to need to change anything.
export PYTHONPATH=/usr/bin/python:.
fab ubuntu bootstrap
