SHORT VERSION
=============

File: **short.txt**
This file is a condensed version of the **config-howto** file.
Both come as part of the RachelSetup[1] directory available
on request: alex@kleider.ca.

===========================
PREPARING THE micro-SD CARD
===========================

It's advisable to check the sha1sum of the download before running the
last of the following commands::

    cd
    mkdir Rachel
    cd Rachel
    wget https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest
    unzip 2016-09-23/raspbian-jessie-lite.zip
    sudo dd if=/path/to/the/image/file.img of=/dev/sdb bs=4M 


==================================
FIRST LOG ON ONTO THE RASPBERRY PI
==================================

I've found that with recent builds of raspbian, ssh'ing onto
the pi fails prior to the running of **raspi-config** so it
appears necessary to first boot up with a screen and keyboard
connected to the Pi.  Don't forget to connect via Ethernet.

----------------
RUN RASPI_CONFIG
----------------

Log on as user 'pi' with password 'raspberry' (NOT 'raspbian'!) 
and then run::

    raspi-config

and configure as appropriate.  Following this, after a reboot,
the pi can be run 'headless.'

======================
UPDATING AND UPGRADING
======================

Use scp to copy the RachelSetup directory hierarchy to the RPi::

    scp -r /home/alex/olpcSF/RachelSetup pi@10.0.0.11:/home/pi/

Then ssh onto the pi to do the following:: 

    cd ~/RachelSetup
    sudo su 
#   mv /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd.original
    # Above doesn't work because file doesn't exist before the upgrade.
    source update.sh  #Must enter 'q' midway through. 
    shutdown -r now


=================
CREATING A SERVER 
=================

Some customization of the hostapd file will most likely be
necessary following which::

    sudo su
    source create_server.sh


==============
MOVING CONTENT
==============

Assuming you have mounted the Rachel Content on /mnt/Rachel
the transfer.sh script contains the command needed::

rsync -av /mnt/Rachel/ /var/www/rachel/


======
Usage:
======

Use an XO laptop (or any other wifi enabled computer) to connect to
the Pi's SSID and then point any browser (on the XO it's the browse
activity) to http://10.10.10.10 to see if it all works.
You should also be able to do the same thing using the following URL:
rachel.lan

Good luck!
