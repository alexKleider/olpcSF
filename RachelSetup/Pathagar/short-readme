# File: short-read
#
# A condensed version of the README.mkd file that
# accompanies the pathagar repository.

# Use fabric to setup Pathagar on your server::
  apt-get install fabric virtualenv
# edit deploy/ubuntu/fabric.py
#      deploy/ubuntu/settings.conf
#      deploy/ubuntu/virtualhost.conf  according to your needs.

# Create directories to hold pathagar's code, logs and environment::
  fab ubuntu bootstrap

# Configure (file locations) and run apache through mod_wsgi::
  fab ubuntu deploy

# Setup databases::
  fab ubuntu create_db
  fab ubuntu setup_db

# Should now have a working instance of
# pathagar running on your server.
