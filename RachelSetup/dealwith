File: dealwith

I'd like to figure out how to deal with the inconvenience caused by
the upgrade process stoping midway to ask for user input to q)uit out
of the following notification:

raspberrypi-sys-mods (20161018+3) jessie; urgency=medium

  * The 20161018 release has introduced a
  * /etc/sudoers.d/010_pi-nopasswd file.
    - The file is installed even if the "pi ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL"
      entry has been
      previously removed from /etc/sudoers by the user.
    - If you do not want the entry to exist, please comment out or
      remove 010_pi-nopasswd.
    - If upgrading to 20161018+3 from a version earlier than 20161018,
      the line in
      010_pi-nopasswd is automatically commented out if the entry
doesn't exist in sudoers.
    - See https://github.com/RPi-Distro/raspberrypi-sys-mods/issues/6

First attempt is to modify a line in update.sh as follows:
date && apt-get -y update && echo 'q' | apt-get -y upgrade && date
i.e. add the "echo 'q' | " part.
